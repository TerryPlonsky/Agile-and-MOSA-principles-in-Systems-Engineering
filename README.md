# Agile-and-MOSA-principles-in-Systems-Engineering
Research data for the 2025 INCOSE Western States Regional Conference
This study aims to evaluate the alignment or misalignment of the principles between the AM and MOSA.
First, a comprehensive literature review of both AM and MOSA principles was performed to support an
assessment of their degree of mutual support, similarities, and differences. Then, each combination was
assigned an assessment score: (0) for little to no alignment, (0.5) for partial alignment, or (1) for full alignment,
along with a detailed rationale. A color-coding system (consisting of red, yellow, and green) was employed
to visually indicate the alignment for each combination.
For further insights into the alignment questions, three large language models (LLMs) were employed:
OpenAI ChatGPT GPT-4o, Google Gemini Flash 2.0, and Microsoft Copilot. Each LLM received the same
prompt template with one example for M1A1: “Does the MOSA principle, establish an enabling environment,
align with the agile manifesto principle, our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
continuous delivery of valuable software?”. The responses from the LLMs were recorded and reviewed to
determine whether their rationale indicated little, partial, or full alignment. Each LLM response was assigned
a similar three-level assessment score and color-coded accordingly. The scores from the LLMs were then
averaged.
Finally, the LLMs’ scores were averaged with the author’s assessment scores to determine the relative ranking
of the 60 combinations on a spectrum of 0 to 1.
